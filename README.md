### Project Overview
This project is a functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additional features like clearing the input, deleting the last entry, and calculating percentages make it more versatile. The interface is designed to be user-friendly with visually appealing styling and responsive behavior.
